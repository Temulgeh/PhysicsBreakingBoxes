# PhysicsBreakingBoxes

### This game was made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 48.

*This project has a lot of code duplication and uses global variables extensively, proceed with caution.*

The reason is that it was the easiest way to do it. There *are* cleaner ways, but given the time constraint I chose to do it this way.

Also I just literally dumped the whole folder, so the builds are in there as well, too bad. But you also get the Aseprite and Musescore files so that's nice.
